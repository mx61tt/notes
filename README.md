# About

This page will be filled with content focused on blockchain, smart contracts, references, and the best materials to learn outside from here.

My name is **mx61tt**, and my intention with this page is to share all my progress through my path to become a smart contract auditor.

My objective with this page is not only to share links, but explain each topic added here as well. In case that I copy some information, I will leave the references from the author(s).
