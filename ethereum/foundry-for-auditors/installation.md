# Installation

The first step to using Foundry is to install it in your work environment. A great advantage of Foundry is that easy to install, in a couple of seconds, you will be able to create your projects and explore this development/testing framework.

The best way to install is to use the command below. However, if you are using Windows, you can check the [installation](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation) page in the Foundry Book.

```
curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
```

And then install Foundry using the command `foundryup.`
